##### Powered by [Totem]

Dungeon Sim is powered by Totem, meaning you can log in using your Totem account and have your own personal Avatar and
choice of weapons in the game.

Also, every achievement you earn in the game, can be shared by other games using Totem, and affect them in different
ways.

Dungeon Sim is connected to two other Totem games:

1. [Frieseria], once you completed the game, you will notice a difference in the health drops.
2. [Island Ambush], once you completed the game, you will receive a second life from the island.
